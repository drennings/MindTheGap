		"Global software development is not a phenomenon but a reality nowadays" <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.459.7894">[1]</a>.
		Hence, more and more companies are using (or at least considering) distributed software engineering as a means to develop
		software. On this website, we consider a global(ly distributed) software engineering (G(D)SE) to be a contractual relationship
		between a client and vendor organization, where the client organization outsources parts of its development process. There
		are a number of advantages to this approach of developing software, such as cost savings, reduced time to market and proximity
		to the market and customer <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-79588-9_1">[2]</a>. Unfortunately,
		these advantages do not come without drawbacks that are the result of the gap between developers, introduced by the distributed
		way of working. Based on renowned work in the area of GDSE (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=293968">[3]</a>),
		we identify this gap alongside four directions: communication, coordination, cultural differences and team bonding. On
		this website we will discuss these categories and divide them in subcategories which pose serious risks to the smooth execution
		of a distributed software engineering project. Per subcategory we serve the reader with solutions that make developers
		happy, namely: technology. In short, we will propose a collection of tools to actively mind the gap in your distributed
		software project.
		<p></p>
		Speaking of tools, we created the following tool for you to explore solutions to challenges in GSE. You can read all of our
		suggestions in a linear manner by scrolling down. But feel free to (first) hover over the core dimensions, subcategories
		and tools for a short description. Clicking on them will take you directly to the details!

			<h1>Four main difficulties in GSE</h1>
			Almost two decades ago(!), Carmel described in his renowned book "Global Software Teams: Collaborating Across Borders and
			Time Zones" (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=293968">[3]</a>) the five centrifugal forces of global software
			teams:
			<ul>
				<li>Geographical dispersion</li>
				<li>Coordination breakdown</li>
				<li>Loss of communication richness</li>
				<li>Loss of teamness</li>
				<li>Cultural differences</li>
			</ul>
			As you may have noticed, we here only discuss four of these forces. We chose to do so since we think that there are no tools
			that directly address and therefore nicely fit the problem of geographical dispersion. Moreover, we see dispersion as
			a force that strengthens the other four centrifugal forces of GSE, for which we do present technology that can help developers
			to manage them. In this approach we also freely translated the forces as defined by Carmel in 1999 to: <b>coordination</b>,
			<b>communication</b>, <b>team bonding</b> and <b>cultural differences</b>. A more elaborate description of these forces,
			their subcategories and tools that may help developers to manage them is provided next.

	<div class="communication text-div">
		<div id="communicationtools">
			<h1>Tools for communication</h1>
			Communication is key in software engineering, but with globally distributed engineering it may very well be even more important,
			while it is also harder to maintain. In addition, this is not limited to the planned communication (such as the daily
			stand ups and sprint reflections). The well renowned 'Allen Curve' from the seventies (<a href="https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/7100210">[6]</a>)
			describes that a gap between two people over 50 meter (or more) drastically reduces the chance of unplanned communicaton.
			Luckily, there are a lot of tools that can support communication in a distributed setting. We divide these tools into
			three subcategories, which can all significantly contribute to closing the virtual gap between multiple software teams.
			The three subcategories are:
			<ul>
				<li>Share tools</li>
				<li>Todo and progress tools</li>
				<li>Free talk</li>
			</ul>
			Since we don't want to present you with a mere description of tools, we also provide argumentations of why these tools could
			be beneficial for your distributed project. The paper <a href="#communicationpaper">Communication tools for distributed software development teams</a>			lists advantages for certain types of tools and their sensory modes (e.g. visual, audio). For example, instant messaging
			tools can provide instant interaction at low cost, but also let you know who is available before you even start interacting
			with one another. Instant messaging allows you to touch upon the visual domain through visuals and raw text, but nowadays
			often covers file sharing (in a graphical context) in addition. Taking into account these types of interaction and what
			helps these interactions become effective, we provide you with a list of tools that are of great benefit in GSE.

		<div id="share">
			<h2>Sharing</h2>
			Communication in teams can happen for several reasons, one of them is sharing code, designs and/or concepts. There are many
			tools that can support communication and workflow. In this section we name a few of those that stand out and can help
			to virtually close the gap to increase unplanned communication. There are a few types of applications that work via a
			sharing concept. Most of them focus on sharing concepts, pieces of code or a new design with the development team, management
			and/or clients in a quick manner. Combined with communication aspects like a bulletin board per project or instant note
			sharing per design screen helps engagement across multiple people, even when they are not close to each other. Another
			benefit brought forward by some sharing applications is the possibility to share your whole screen. This for instance
			allows developers that are far away from each other to still work via pair programming.



		</div>

		<div id="conceptshare">
			<h3>ConceptShare</h3>
			ConceptShare is a communication tool especially designed for creative types. It helps you streamline the review and approval
			process for any project and it allows for online proofing with workflow automation. With this tool you can work with clients
			from one place without having to send a hundred emails back and forth.
			<br/> <br/> ConceptShare can work well in global software engineering for multiple reasons. While the design process is
			ongoing and new requirements are still being introduced, a lot of communication is needed. In this process, sharing designs
			and documents and creating a steady workflow are of great benefit. Because ConceptShare makes you interact in an efficient
			way and asks for updates when the product changes, interactions will happen on a more frequent basis.

			Clients can provide feedback and comments directly on the site and track progress in real-time by looking at your to-do
			list.
			<br/><br/> InVision can help in global system engineering in the design phase. InVision lets off-shore designers create
			a full app in a mock-up way where you can click through the app. By adding to-do's while clicking through the app, you
			can communicate in an efficient way.

			Screen hero is screen sharing software which works well in combination with Slack. Screen Hero allows members of the team
			to share their screen in real time, and allows multiple cursors so you can actually pair program on someone else’s machine.
			<br/><br/> With Screen Hero you can thus combine the power of inhouse programmers with off-shore programmers, both concerning

			<h3>BlueJeans</h3>
			BlueJeans is a cloud video conferencing platform, which enables your remote teams to video conference on any platform with
			ease. Seeing the other party when communicating can be a beneficial factor for bonding and expressing yourself, which
			is hard to do in GSE because of the distance between remote teams.
			<br/><br/> In GSE communication is key, but many communiation tools rely on instant messaging or concept sharing, which
			are all good for their own purpose, but for meetings it can be essential to see the other party. Expressing emotion for
			instance is very hard to do via text alone. When you are able to see the other person, you bond more, and can get your
			point across in more ways than only text. A conversation gets more natural With facial expressions or hand gestures, this
			will avoid misunderstandings and wrong assumptions.

			<h2>To-do's</h2>
			To-do's can be seen as a subcategory of coordination, but we here make a distinction between coordination tools for management
			purposes (discussed in the coordination category) and coordination tools that heavily increase communication between developers
			(discussed here). Tools that ease the work of developers are more likely to be used often by them. If these tools in turn
			also have social features, the chance for unplanned communication increases. That is why the following tools are beneficial
			for not only communication but also project progress.
		</div>
		<div id="asana">
            <p></p>
			<h3>Asana</h3>
			Asana is a free project management tool designed to help teams track projects from start to finish. One of its best features
			is that it lets you see the overall progress of your project step by step, so your clients know exactly how long something
			will take without having to bug you about it.
			<br/><br/> Asana is a great tool for globally distributed software engineering, for managers, developers and clients.
			With Asana you can plan your sprints, and every item on the sprint has its own message board. Asana also asks for regular
			updates on the project-wide message board. This actually forces you to post something on the board, with a big chance
			that others will respond. The project-wide board is for managers and even clients to see what the progress is, but also
			for developers working on different parts of the software to see how everyone is progressing. This transforms the project
			into a much more living and social entity.

			with clients so they can see exactly what you’re up to and when you’re working. It is available on both desktop and mobile,
			so you can update it on the go. If you have clients who want to see the project laid out in detail, this tool will definitely
			help.
			<br/><br/> Wunderlist has a lot in common with its direct competitor Asana and is thereby for exactly the same reasons
			a great addition to GSE. Which tool to use is up to your preference.

		<div id="basecamp">
            <p></p>
			<h3>Basecamp</h3>
			Basecamp is a very popular web-based project management tool that helps multiple groups rally around a single project. Because
			the project is the focus, you can create a system where both you and the client are on the same page about various stages
			of the project.
			<br/><br/> Basecamp focuses on everything in one place and cutting meetings. This essentially is decreasing the total
			amount of communication, but increasing the amount of effective communication. Because everything is in one place, it
			is ideal for GSE. Everyone can see what is going on and organize their communication in the same place. Group chatting,
			scheduling and sharing is all available in basecamp which increases the chance of communication for distributed teams
			thus helping decrease the virtual gap.

			be assigned to a person or a team which is especially useful for teams that are located around the world.
			<br/><br/> Trello is much like Basecamp, however it focuses more on management then communication, it is still increasing
			the chance of unplanned communication because deveopers work in one organized place. Much like Basecamp the advantages
			lie in a centralized place for organizing communication and isssues.

			<h2>Free talk</h2>
			Aside from the communication solely based on work related stuff, it is important that employees also have tools that can
			be used for all kind of random talk. Hence, the last section of communication is about free talk. This helps the creativity
			flow and can improve working relations. There are a lot of tools for this, think of instant messaging and social platforms.
			We will discuss a few that stand out for office use and explain their popularity and why they are suited best for GSE.
		</div>
		<div id="slack">
            <p></p>
			<h3>Slack</h3>
			Slack is a popular communication tool and for good reason. It takes the best of email and live-chat features and combines
			them into one app that you can use on your desktop or mobile device. Aside from private messages you can also create collaborative
			boards around different projects or topics, which is helpful if you’re working with a larger team of people or on multiple
			projects with a single client at once.

			<br/><br/> Slack may be the best messenger suited for GSE and free talk. Slack works by joining a slack group where all
			your employees/colleagues can be in. From there you can easily create separate channels with the people you need/want
			for any reason. Channels could be project-specific, but you can also create channels for Friday drinks and other random
			stuff. The strength of Slack is then that everyone can reach each other in a very simple way. The simplicity is then the
			reason that the chance on unplanned communication increases.

            <p></p>
			<h3>Appear.in</h3>
			Appear.in focuses on remotely distrubted teams and is in essence build for GSE. You can use it right from your browser by
			creating a new chatroom that enables you to share your screen(s) and have group conversations.
			<br/><br/> What makes Appear.in great for GSE and closing the virtual gap is the simplicity of use: you can join whenever
			you want on your mobile/laptop or office PC by just entering the given chatroom address in your browser. Naturally, you
			still need to have a cause to create a chatroom, but the simplicity to join somewhat closes the virtual gap between the
			remote teams. Tools that are always running will sometimes be overlooked, wich may very well lead to slower and less utilized
			communiation channels. On the other hand, when a new chatroom was created and you get invited, there is probably a cause
			and multiple people will join quickly. This way communiation is improved and with all the features this specific chatroom
			brings, it is of great use in GSE.

			<h3>Skype for business/Microsoft Teams</h3>
			It is very likely that you have used Skype at least once and therefore know that such a tool is a must have when it comes
			to GSE, so we will not elaborate on that. However, it might be interesting to really look into the advanced features of
			skype, such as sharing files, screens or a digital whiteboard while calling. There are plenty of ways to use skype as
			a real GDSE supportive tool, rather than "just" sending your voice across the globe.
			<br/><br/> Microsoft Teams is bascially following up Skype for business and has more features like Slack and is becoming
			a direct competitor of the previously discussed tool. MS Teams is heavily gaining traction because Skype was already widely
			in businesses. Another advantage lies with the fact that bigger companies naturally are more likely to use Microsoft's
			software. Some also say that you can interact more quickly by using Microsoft Teams.

			<h1>Tools for Coordination</h1>
			Coordination in software development teams can be divided into the following categories:
			<ul>
				<li> Centralized Structure</li>
				<li> Early Identification of Dependencies</li>
				<li> Documentation</li>
				<li> Progress Analysis</li>
			</ul>
			The above categories all describe a domain where the coordination of a project becomes more difficult when the teams are
			further away from each other. These are thus the domains in which improvement of coordination is needed in order to bring
			teams closer together and make the whole developoment process go more smoothly. The coordination tools have a big overlap
			with communication as communiction is in fact a coordination tool.

		<div id="centralstruct">

			<h2 id="centralstruct">Centralized Structure</h2>
			If the structure of the project is clear and decisions about the structure are centralized in one place then the communication

			Github is the main versioning tool for software projects. On their website you can browse your repositories and comment on
			all parts of a project. You can also mention other people to involve them in the conversation if they need to hear what
			is being said. In addition to that users can turn on notifications for certain repositories to get all the updates they
			need.

			<h3>JIRA</h3>
			JIRA is an advanced project tracker that helps software development teams with issue and bug tracking. It also offers online
			scrum boards and agile reporting tools for sprints. These tools are very useful for tracking the project's progress for
			teams that are spread around the globe because they are accessible online. Remote teams can thus interact with each other
			more easily and in an effective way for the project.

			<h1>Tools for cultural differences</h1>
			Another problem that causes a gap between members of a global distributed software engineering project is culture. Using
			global distributed software engineering often means working with people all over the world, people that can have different
			cultures. These different cultures can sometimes fit well together without effort, but can sometimes cause problems for
			people working together. In order to bring down the gap between team members, cultural differences must be dealt with.
			However, it is important to note that there are a few pieces of technology that really adhere to this. We here discuss
			some of those, but more elaborately focus on the steps to take when managing cultural differences. The tools we propose
			are thus a means to help you do so.
		</div>
		<div id="managing">
            <p></p>
			<h2>Managing:</h2>
			Managing a culturally diverse team is different from managing a team consisting of members with the same cultural background.
			To help manage a multi-cultural team there are three different aspects that can help according to <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=975818">[4]</a>:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Systems to harmonize between outsourcer and supplier</b></li>
				The first goal can be achieved by using technology and coordination/control systems so members of the team can be kept up
				to date of the process of the project. Universal tools that are understood by everyone in the field independent of culture
				can help accomplish that.
				<li><b>Understand differences in norms and values</b></li>
				The second point is about defining the hierarchy/power between the members and the companies. State how different people
				practice business differently and define which aspects should be included in the project and which should not.
				<li><b>Encourage 'negotiated culture' of cross-cultural teams developing compromise 'working culture'</b></li>
				The last point concerns the exchange of mechanisms between members, so that members can learn from each other and try create
				custom mechanisms for the current team that work for all the members.
			</ul>
			We believe the following tools can help to this end:
			<ul>
				<li id="globesmart"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.aperianglobal.com/learning-solutions/online-learning-tools/globesmart/">Globesmart</a>					is a tool that helps manage a culturally diverse team. The tool provides information on managing the team and how to
					do assessments. </li>
				<li id="git"><a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> helps with version control and mananging projects, independent
					of any culture.</li>
				<li id="github"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a version control platform tool, that is a standard in the
					software engineering industry. Thus this tool can be used to manage files, independent of culture. </li>
				<li id="trellocd"><a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> can help provide a general overview of the progress of the project.
					It can help planning with SCRUM and Agile development. </li>
				<li id="jira"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> can be used to manage projects in an easy
					to understand way, independent of any culture. </li>
				<li id="slackcd">In order to communicate for exchanging experience and methods between team members of different cultures, <a target="_blank"
					 href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> can be used. Slack can help with both sending files, using bots, and chat. </li>
				<li id="skypecd"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> can be used to have a direct communication line for team members
					to exchange methods and experience. </li>
			</ul>

		</div>
		<div id="staff">
            <p></p>
			<h2>Staff:</h2>
			Choosing the right staff is another important aspect for overcoming cultural differences. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=975818">[4]</a>			defines the following three points related to choosing the right staff:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Recognize limits to cultural adaptation</b></li>
				The first point states that there are limits to adaption of culture. So foreigners cannot become locals and vice versa. Don’t
				try to change people completely so that only one culture exists in the team.
				<li><b>Use 'cultural bridging' staff</b></li>
				The second point states that there should be an effort to have people in the team that are familiar with both cultures in
				the team. These people can help bridge the differences between the team members with different cultures.
				<li><b>Use locally-relevant recruitment and retention incentives</b></li>
				The last point is about the different salary and status/expertise acquisition. Make sure that these are according to the
				standards of the different culture, but are not too different in the team.
			</ul>

			We believe the following tools can help to this end:
			<ul>
				<li id="linkedin"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> is a tool that can provide the right staff for the team.
					It can also be used to search for developers who are multi-cultural.
			</ul>

		</div>
		<div id="training">
            <p></p>
			<h2>Training:</h2>
			The last aspect is training. The team needs to be trained so they learn how to communicate and work together with the different
			team members. Three aspects can be looked into when considering training:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Give pro-posting cultural training for supplier employees working in outsourcer companies (supplier)</b></li>
				The first point is about learning the language and cultural practices, norms and values. This way team members know how different
				people have different views on various aspects.
				<li><b>Develop systematic on-the-job cross-cultural training</b></li>
				The second point is used to reflect on ongoing experience and share knowledge with colleagues, so that the team members can
				learn from each other and how they experienced and handle curtain (technical) situations.
				<li><b>Recognize that training needs are two-way (outsourcer)</b></li>
				The third point makes sure that not only the outsourced part of the team is trained, but the local team should be trained
				to work with different members as well. This way the local team can get familiar with the outsourced team members so
				they know what drives them and how to best communicate and work together with them.
			</ul>

			We believe the following tools can help to this end:
			<ul>
				<li id="duolingo"><a target="_blank" href="https://duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> is a tool that can help members of the team to learn languages
					spoken by other members of the team in an easy and fun way. This can help understand different team members better.
			</ul>

			</center>
            <p></p>
			Summarizing, in order to close the gap between different team members, cultural differences must be dealt with. By looking
			at managing, staff and training a diverse team can become easy to work with and should be efficient when doing globally
			distributed software engineering.

			<h1>Tools for team bonding</h1>
			One thing that will increase productivity as well as quality in a global software project is team bonding. A team with strong
			social bonding will have less need for tools and formal procedures, because many issues will already be resolved informally.
			Sue Newell, Carole Tansley and Jimmy Huang define two kinds of social capital, described in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2004.00405.x/epdf">[5]</a>:
			External bridging social capital, and internal bonding social capital. While this section has few tools, it is worth to
			note that this is still a very important category. Team bonding however has a very strong social aspect, and a lack of
			teamness represents a problem that cannot easily be removed by extra communication or coordination. It is very much a
			feeling, and as such this is a challenge that has been faced since whenever people started to perform tasks together rather
			than by themselves. As a result of that, there are many non-technical solutions, which precede the technical age, which
			are often preferrable solutions over developing new tools, which explains the lack. Nonetheless we will try to give you
			a feeling of what is out there concerning tools to support team bonding.
		</div>
		<div id="extbonding">
			<h2> External bridging social capital</h2>
			External bridging social capital tools are tools that increase a feeling of 'teamness' between different teams that are working
			on different locations/projects. An often observed occurrance is that while internal trust and cohesion of the different
			teams are fine, there is little trust between teams on different locations. Note that many of the tools described before
			increase this bonding and trust. Here we discuss two other tools that can support your distributed project.
		</div>
		<div id="ariadne">
			<h3>Ariadne</h3>
			Ariadne was initiated in 1996 by the European Commission's telematics for education and training program. Since then, an
			infrastructure has been developed in Belgium and Switzerland for the production of reusable learning content, including
			distributed storage and discovery, as well as its exploitation in structured courses. The core of this infrastructure
			is a distributed library of digital, reusable educational components called the Knowledge Pool System (KPS) now actively
			used in both academic and corporate contexts.

		</div>
		<div id="SocialTFS">
			<h3>SocialCDE</h3>
			SocialCDE (formerly SocialTFS) is an extension of Collaborative Development Enviroments (aka ALM platforms) to aggregate
			teammates’ content from social software into the developer’s workspace. Current services include CodePlex, Team Foundation
			Server, and GitHub as supported CDEs. We also provide plugins for Visual Studio and Eclipse-based IDEs to aggregate and
			show socio-technical content from the following Twitter and Facebook. SocialCDE is part of a research project in the areas
			of Social Software Engineering and Global Software Development, led by the Collaborative Development Group at the University
			of Bari, Italy. SocialTFS has been developed to support our hypothesis that information shared on social media can work
			as a surrogate of the social awareness gained during informal chats, thus helping to build trust among members of global
			teams.

		</div>
		<div id="intbonding">
			<h2> Internal bonding social capital</h2>
			Another challenge that can play a role in globally distributed software engineering is the internal bonding social capital
			of a team. If there is no internal trust, this will have serious impact on the quality of the software. It is worth to
			note there are almost no tools available that have strengthening internal social capital as an explicit goal. Most often
			these are found to be secondary goals, and even then rarely this is rarely explicitly mentioned. While this may be considered
			a gap in current technology, one must also think that while there may not be explicit software to strengthen these bonds,
			there are many other ways internal teambonding can be strengthened. For internal social capital has the advantage that
			the entire team is on the same place. It's an entire field in the study of management where, and there are as many techniques
			as there are experts. The lack of software most likely does not reflect a lack of solutions to the problem, it's just
			that this part of the problem may not be one that is most easily solved by adding more tools.
