		"Global software development is not a phenomenon but a reality nowadays" <a href="http://www.lu.lv/materiali/apgads/raksti/733_pp_9-23.pdf">[1]</a>.  
        Hence, more and more companies are using (or at least considering) distributed software engineering as a means to develop software. 
        On this website, we speak of global(ly distributed) software engineering (G(D)SE) as a contractual relationship between a client
		and vendor organization, where the client organization outsources parts of its development process. There are a number
		of advantages to this approach of developing software, such as cost savings, reduced time to market and proximity to the market and customer <a href="http://www.brian-fitzgerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/icsp08-final-draft.pdf">[2]</a>.
		Unfortunately, these advantages do not come without drawbacks that are the result of a gap between developers. A renowned study in the area of GDSE identifies this gap alongside four directions: communication, coordination, cultural differences and team bonding.
        In the following we discuss these categories and divide them in subcategories which pose serious risks to the smooth execution of a distributed software engineering project. Per subcategory we serve the reader with solutions that make developers happy, namely: technology. 
        Shortley said, we propose a collection of tools to actively mind the gap in your distributed software project.
        <br />
        Talking about tools, we created the following tool for you to explore solutions to challenges in GSE. 
        If you want, you can read all of our suggestions in a linear manner by scrolling down. 
        But if you are in a hurry, you can hover over the core categories, subcategories and tools to get a feeling of their meaning. 
        Clicking on them, will actually send you right away to the details.

	<div class="communication text-div">
		<h1>Tools for communication</h1>
		In this section we will primarily discuss the mentioned tools communication-wise. Communication is key in software engineering,
		but with globally distributed engineering, communication is harder to maintain. Thomas Allen invented 'The Allen Curve'
		in the seventies, the curve describes that a gap between two people over 50 meter drastically reduces the chance of unplanned
		communicaton. However there are a lot of tools nowadays that can help increase communication again which is beneficial
		for productivity. We divide communication tools into three subcategories, which are all important to closing the virtual
		gap between multiple software teams. The three sub categories are:
		<ul>
			<li>Share tools</li>
			<li>Todo and progress tools</li>
			<li>Free talk</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- TODO: use numbers and other sources to get a better story for the tools. -->
		<div id="share">
			<h2>Sharing</h2>
			Communication in teams can happen for several reasons, one of them is sharing code, designs and/or concepts. There are many
			tools that benefit communication and workflow, in this section a few are named that stand out. All these tools can help
			close the distance gap virtually to increase unplanned communication.

			<h3 id="conceptshare">ConceptShare</h3>
			ConceptShare is a communication tool especially designed for creative types. It helps you streamline the review and approval
			process for any project, and it allows for online proofing with workflow automation, which means you can work with clients
			from one place without having to send a hundred emails back and forth.
			<br/> <br/> ConceptShare can work well in global software engineering for multiple reasons. Mostly because while the design
			process is ongoing and new requirements are still being introduced, a lot of communication is needed. In this process,
			sharing designs, documents and creating a steady workflow are of great benefit. Because ConceptShare makes you interact
			in an efficient way and needs updates when the product changes, interactions will happen in a more steady basis.

			<h3 id="invision">InVision</h3>
			InVision is a web-based (and mobile) app that lets designers/developers turn their work into active prototypes with animations.
			Clients can provide feedback and comments directly on the site and track progress in real-time by looking at your to-do
			list.
			<br/><br/> InVision can help in global system engineering in the design phase. InVision lets designers off-shore create
			a full app in a mock-up way where you can click through the app. Via todo's that you can immediately add when clicking
			through you can communicate in an efficient way.

			<h3 id="screenhero">Screen Hero</h3>
			Screen hero is screen sharing software, it works well in combination with Slack. Screen Hero allows members of the team to
			share their screen in real time, and to allow multiple cursors so you can actually pair program on someone else’s machine.
			<br/><br/> With Screen Hero you can actually combine the power of inhouse programmers with off-shore programmers. Pair
			programming is made much easier with Screen Hero and problem can be solved much faster when inhouse programmers can help,
			or the other way around.

		<div id="tasks">
			<h2>Todo's</h2>
			Todo's can be seen as a subcategory of coordination, but we make a distinction between coordination tools for management purposes and coordination tools that heavily increase communication between developers.
			Tools that ease the work of developers are more likely to be used often by them. If these tools in turn also have social features this means the chance on unplanned communication increases.
			That is why the following tools are beneficial for not only communication but also project progress.
			<h3 id="asana">Asana</h3>
				Asana is a free project management tool designed to help teams track projects from start to finish. One of its best features
				is that it lets you see the overall progress of your project step by step, so your clients know exactly how long something
				will take without having to bug you about it.
				<br/><br/>
				Asana is a great tool for globally distributed software engineering, for managers, developers and clients. With Asana you can plan your sprints, and every item on the sprint has it's own message board.
				Asana also asks for regular updates on the project wide message board, this atually forces you to post something on the board, with a big chance that others will respond. 
				The project wide board is for managers and even clients to see what the progress is, but also for developers working on different parts of the software, how everyone is developing. 
				This makes the project a much more living and social entity.
				<br/><br/>
				<a href=" https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Try out Asana</a>

				</center>
				
			<h3 id="wunderlist">Wunderlist</h3>
				Wunderlist is a to-do list tool that helps you plan your individual tasks, set notifications and reminders, and collaborate
				with clients so they can see exactly what you’re up to and when you’re working. It is available
				on both desktop and mobile so you can update it on the go. If you have clients who want to see the project laid out in
				detail, this will help.
				<br/><br/>
				Very much like Asana, and a direct competitor is Wunderlist. For exactly the same reasons a great addition to GSE.

			<h3>Basecamp</h3>
				Basecamp is a very popular web-based project management tool that helps multiple groups rally around a single project. Because
				the project is the focus, you can create a system where both you and the client are on the same page about various stages
				of the project.
		</div>

		<div id="freely">
			<h2>Free talk</h2>
			Aside from the communication solely based on work related stuff, it is important that employees also have tools that can be used for all kind of random talk.
			So the last section of communication is about free talk. This helps the creativity flow and can improve working relations. There are a lot of tools for this, think of instant messaging, social platforms.
			We will discuss a few that stand out for office use and explain the popularity and why they are suited best for GSE.
			<h3 id="slack">Slack</h3>
				Slack is a popular communication tool, and for good reason. It takes the best of email and live-chat features and combines
				them into one app that you can use on your desktop or mobile device. Aside from private messages you can also create
				collaborative boards around different projects or topics, which is helpful if you’re working with a larger team of people
				or on multiple projects with a single client at once.

				<br/><br/>
				Slack may be the best messenger suited for GSE and free talk. Slack works by joining a slack group where all your employees/colleagues should be in. 
				From there you can create channels easily with the people you need/want for any reason. Channels could be project specific, but you can also create channels for friday drinks and other random stuff.
				The strength of slack is then that everyone can reach each other in a very simple way. The simplicity is then the reason that the chance on unplanned communication increases.

	<div class="coordination text-div">
		<h1>Tools for Coordination</h1>
			Coordination in software development teams can be divided into the following categories:
			<ul>
				<li> Centralized Structure</li>
				<li> Early Identification of Dependencies</li>
				<li> Documentation</li>
				<li> Progress Analysis</li>
			</ul>
			The above categories all describe a domain where the coordination of a project becomes more difficult when the teams are
			further away from each other. These are thus the domains in which improvement of coordination is needed in order to bring
			teams closer together and make the whole developoment process go more smoothly. The coordination tools have a big overlap
			with communication as communiction is in fact a coordination tool.
			<h2>Centralized Structure</h2>
			If the structure of the project is clear and decisions about the structure 
			are centralized in one place then the communication about it is also clear. 
			Everyone knows how the project is formed and that makes the communication 
			and coordination about it more easy. Below are two software analytics tools 
			that help in analysing projects and making the structure and statistics 
			of the project more available. 
			<h3>SonarQube</h3>
			SonarQube is a software project analytics tool to which you can connect a 
			git repository. SonarQube then analyses your project's structure and quality.
			These analytics are available to everyone at any time
			<h3>Codefactor</h3>
			Codefactor is another software analytics tool which helps in analysing the 
			code base of your project. The tool also easily connects to git and gives 
			a clear overview of each branch available in the project. 

			<h2>Identification of Dependencies</h2>
			For a global software development team it is important that remote teams 
			are not working on dependent parts of the project. So it is necessary that 
			these dependencies are figured out as early as possible. Below is a project 
			planning tool that in combination with a software analytics tool can help
			in identification in dependencies such that no two remote teams are working 
			on dependent parts.
			<h3>Trello</h3>
			Trello is the planning tool in which all parts of the project can be listed.
			This tool offers one location which everyone can access and can use to discuss
			current dependencies and planning about the project. In trello tasks can also 
			be assigned to a person or a team which is especially useful for teams that 
			are located around the world.
			<h3>Github</h3>
			Github is the main versioning tool for software projects. With this tool 
			each team can add new work on their own branch. With this it becomes clear 
			what features are being added. With Github the structure of the project can 
			also be analysed to detect dependencies of different project parts. 

			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			For teams that do not run in to each other on the workfloor it is particularly
			essential that the documentation of the project is up to date and clear. When 
			a certain part of the project is unclear you could ask someone in person for 
			extra clarification but for remote teams this is impossible. Thus it is important 
			to have proper documentation to prevent these situations. Below are two tools 
			that provide a good way to keep the documentation up to date.
			<h3>Github Wiki</h3>
			Github Wiki is a tool on github which you can link to your project's repository.
			In this tool you can create all sorts of pages on every subject you can think of.
			These pages are automatically added to the sidebar in alphabetical order. 
			The search bar makes for an even more accessible body of information. The 
			best part is that anyone in your business can access these pages and make 
			new ones.			
			<h3>ReadTheDocs</h3>
			ReadTheDocs is a similar documentation tool to Github wiki pages. It also allows
			for easy creation and searching of documentation but it does not simply list 
			all pages but pages can also be grouped and categorised. It let's the user 
			browse the documentation more easily when he or she does not certainly know 
			what to search for.

			<h2>Progress Analysis</h2>
			The way the teams in a company are integrated with each other decides how 
			internal relations between the teams are set. These relations determine 
			what information and updates about the project a team needs from other teams.
			<h3>Github</h3>
			Github is the main versioning tool for software projects. On their website 
			you can browse your repositories and comment on all parts of a project. You can 
			also mention other people to innvolve them in the conversation if they need 
			to hear what is being said. In addition to that users can turn on notifications 
			for certain repositories to get all the updates they need.
			<h3>Palantir</h3>
			Palantir is a software development conflict detection tool that detects 
			conflicts in parallel changes to a large code base. When remote teams work 
			separately and they don't meet each other when walking around in the office 
			this conlficting work might go unnoticed for a while and results in double 
			work being done for nothing. This tool detects changes to the project and 
			notifies the teams of any potential conflicts.

	<div class="cultural text-div">
		<h1>Tools for cultural differences</h1>
		<p>
			A problem that causes a gap between members of a global distributed software engineering project is culture. Using global
			distributed software engineering means working with people all over the world, people who thus have different cultures.
			These different cultures can sometimes fit together, but can also be a problem for people to work together. In order to
			bring down the gap between team members, cultural differences must be dealt with. To do so the following tools can help.
			<h2>Managing:</h2>
			Managing a culture diverse team is different from managing a team consisting of members with the same cultural background.
			To help manage a multi-cultural team there are three different aspects that can help according to 1:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Systems to harmonize between outsourcer and supplier</b></li>
				The first point can be done by using technology and coordination/control systems so members of the team can be kept up to
				date of the process of the project. Universal tools that is understood by everyone in the field independent of culture can help accomplish that.
				<li><b>Understand differences in norms and values</b></li>
				The second point is about defining the hierarchy/power between the members and the companies. State how different people
				practice business differently and define which aspects should be included in the project and which not.
				<li><b>Encourage 'negotiated culture' of cross-cultural teams developing compromise 'working culture'</b></li>
				The last point concerns the exchange of mechanisms between members, so that members can learn from each other and try create
				custom mechanisms for the current team that works with all the members.
			</ul>

			<h3 id="globesmart"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.aperianglobal.com/learning-solutions/online-learning-tools/globesmart/">Globesmart</a></h3>
			GlobeSmart is a tool that helps manage a cultural diverse team. The tool provides information on managening the team and how to do assements.

			<h3 id="git"><a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></h3>
			Using Git helps with version control and mananging projects, independent of any culture.

			<h3 id="github"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></h3>
			GitHub is a version control platform tool, that is a standard in the software engineering industry. Thus this tool can be used to manage files, independent of culture.

			<h3 id="trello"><a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a></h3>
			Trello can help provide a general overview of the progress of the project. It can help planning with SCRUM and Agile development.

			<h3 id="jira"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a></h3>
			JIRA can be used to manage projects in an easy to understand way, independent of any culture.

			<h3 id="slack"><a target="_blank" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a></h3>
			In order to communicate for exchanging experience and methods between team members of different cultures, slack can be used. Slack can help with both sending files, using bots, and chat.

			<h3 id="skype"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.skype.com/">Skype</a></h3>
			Skype can be used to have a direct communication line for team members to exchange methods and experience.

			<h2>Staff:</h2>
			Choosing the right staff is another important aspect for overcoming cultural differences. 1 defines the following three points
			related to choosing the right staff:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Recognize limits to cultural adaptation</b></li>
				The first point states that there are limits to adaption of culture. So foreigners cannot become locals and vice versa. Don’t
				try to change people completely so that only one culture exists in the team.
				<li><b>Use 'cultural bridging' staff</b></li>
				The second point tries to have people in the team that is familiar with both cultures in the team. These people can help
				bridge the differences between the team members with different cultures.
				<li><b>Use locally-relevant recruitment and retention incentives</b></li>
				The last point is about the different salary and status/expertise acquisition. Make sure that these are according to the
				standards of the different culture, but are not too different in the team.
			</ul>

			<h3 id="linkedin"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a></h3>
			Linkedin is a tool that can provide the right staff for the team. It can also be used to search for developers who are multicultural.

			<h2>Training:</h2>
			The last aspect is training. The team needs to be trained so they learn how to communicate and work together with the different
			team members. Three aspects can be looked into when considering training 1:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Give pro-posting cultural training for supplier employees working in outsourcer companies (supplier)</b></li>
				The first point is about learning the language and cultural practices, norms and values. This way team members know how different
				people have different views on various aspects.
				<li><b>Develop systematic on-the-job cross-cultural training</b></li>
				The second point is used to reflect on ongoing experience and share knowledge with colleagues, so that the team members can
				learn from each other and how they experienced and handle curtain (technical) situations.
				<li><b>Recognize that training needs are two-way (outsourcer)</b></li>
				The third point makes sure that not only the outsourced part of the team is trained, but the local team should be trained
				to work with different members as well. This way the local team can get familiar with the outsourced team members so they
				know what drives them and how the best communicate and work together with them.
			</ul>

			<h3 id="duolingo"><a target="_blank" href="https://duolingo.com">duolingo</a></h3>
			Duolingo is a tool that can help members of the team to learn languages spoken by other members of the team in an easy and fun way. This can help understand different team members better.

			So in order to close the gap between different team members, cultural differences must be dealt with. By looking at managing, staff and training a diverse team can become easy to work with and should be efficient when doing globally distributed software engineering.
