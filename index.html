		<h1>So you want to do GSE?</h1>
			Are you part of a globally distributed software engineering project? Or trying to learn how to manage one? Or maybe you didn’t even start such a project, 
			but are looking to engage in one and want to know how to deal with the challenges of a globally distributed software engineering project. Then you came to 
			the right place! More and more companies are using globally distributed software engineering as a tool for their software development process. On this website,
			we speak of Globally distributed software engineering as a contractual relationship between a client and vendor organization, where the client organization 
			outsources parts of its development process. There are a number of advantages of globally distributed software engineering which are stated in 
			<a href="http://www.brian-fitzgerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/icsp08-final-draft.pdf">this paper</a>. This website will focus mainly on the solutions of the disadvantages, which is why this website is setup by a group of students from 
			the Technical University of Delft. We are trying to propose valuable solutions to four core challenges which pose serious risks to the smooth execution 
			of a globally distributed software engineering project. These four core challenges are communication, coordination, cultural differences and team bonding. 
			In the next section a “skillmap” is defined for these four challenges. Per challenge a number of sub challenges are defined and per sub challenge solutions 
			are proposed. These can be accessed by hovering your mouse through the “skillmap”.
