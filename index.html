		<h1>Tools for communication</h1>
		In this section we will primarily discuss the mentioned tools communication-wise. Communication is key in software engineering,
		but with globally distributed engineering, communication is harder to maintain. ... describes that a gap between two people
		<!-- TODO ... -->
		over 50 meter, drastically reduces the chance to meet up and talk. However there are a lot of tools nowadays that can help
		increase communication again which is beneficial for productivity. We divide communication tools into three subcategories,
		which are all important to closing the virtual gap between multiple software teams. The three sub categories are:
		<ul>
			<li>Share tools
				<!-- TODO: change this name into something fancier -->
			</li>
			<li>Task and reporting tools</li>
			<li>Free talk</li>
		</ul>

		<div id="share">
			<h2>Sharing is caring</h2>

			<h3>ConceptShare</h3>
			<p>
				ConceptShare is a communication tool especially designed for creative types. It helps you streamline the review and approval
				process for any project, and it allows for online proofing with workflow automation, which means you can work with clients
				from one place without having to send a hundred emails back and forth.
			</p>

			<h3>InVision</h3>
			<p>
				InVision is web-based (and mobile) app that lets designers/developers turn their work into active prototypes with animations.
				Clients can provide feedback and comments directly on the site and track progress in real-time by looking at your to-do
				list.
			</p>

			<h3>Screen Hero</h3>
			<p> This screen sharing software works well with Slack (who recently bought by them). Screen Hero allows members of the team
				to share their screen in real time, and to allow multiple cursors so you can actually pair program on someone else’s
				machine.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="tasks">
			<h2>Task and reporting</h2>
			<h3>Basecamp</h3>
			<p>
				Basecamp is a very popular web-based project management tool that helps multiple groups rally around a single project. Because
				the project is the focus, you can create a system where both you and the client are on the same page about various stages
				of the project.
			</p>
			<h3>Trello</h3>
			<p>
				Trello is another popular project management application system designed to break down projects into manageable “cards” that
				you can assign to different people. If you’re looking to create a collaborative team environment without worrying about
				being micromanaged (or needing to micromanage), Trello is the perfect solution. It also has the bonus of adding a visual
				element to otherwise technical projects.
			</p>
			<h3>Asana</h3>
			<p>
				Asana is a free project management tool designed to help teams track projects from start to finish. One of its best features
				is that it lets you see the overall progress of your project step by step, so your clients know exactly how long something
				will take without having to bug you about it.
			</p>
			<h3>Wunderlist</h3>
			<p>
				Wunderlist is a to-do list tool that helps you plan your individual tasks, set notifications and reminders, and collaborate
				with clients so they can see exactly what you’re up to and when you’re working. The best part is that it’s available
				on both desktop and mobile so you can update it on the go. If you have clients who want to see the project laid out in
				detail, this will help.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="freely">
			<h2>Free talk</h2>
			<h3>Slack</h3>
			<p>Slack is a popular communication tool, and for good reason. It takes the best of email and live-chat features and combines
				them into one app that you can use on your desktop or mobile device. Aside from private messages you can also create
				collaborative boards around different projects or topics, which is helpful if you’re working with a larger team of people
				or on multiple projects with a single client at once.
