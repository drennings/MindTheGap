		<h1>Tools for communication</h1>
		In this section we will primarily discuss the mentioned tools communication-wise. Communication is key in software engineering,
		but with globally distributed engineering, communication is harder to maintain. ... describes that a gap between two people
		over 50 meter, drastically reduces the chance to meet up and talk. However there are a lot of tools nowadays that can help
		increase communication again which is beneficial for productivity. We divide communication tools into three subcategories,
		which are all important to closing the virtual gap between multiple software teams. The three sub categories are:
		<ul>
			<li>Share tools
				<!-- TODO: change this name into something fancier -->
			</li>
			<li>Task and reporting tools</li>
			<li>Free talk</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>ConceptShare</h3>

				process for any project, and it allows for online proofing with workflow automation, which means you can work with clients
