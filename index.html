		``Global software development is not a phenomenon but a reality nowadays.'' (http://www.lu.lv/materiali/apgads/raksti/733_pp_9-23.pdf)  
        Hence, more and more companies are using (or at least considering) distributed software engineering as a means to develop software. 
        On this website, we speak of (globally) distributed software engineering as a contractual relationship between a client
		and vendor organization, where the client organization outsources parts of its development process. There are a number
		of advantages of this approach to software development which are stated in
		<a href="http://www.brian-fitzgerald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/icsp08-final-draft.pdf">this paper</a>
		<!-- TODO: Wim add such as .... -->. However, these advantages do not come without drawbacks. On this website we discuss these advantages and serve the reader with solutions in the form of technology. 
        We propose valuable solutions to the four core challenges
		which pose serious risks to the smooth execution of a distributed software engineering project. These four core
		challenges are communication, coordination, cultural differences and team bonding. 
        
        In the next section a “skillmap” is
		defined for these four challenges. Per challenge a number of sub challenges are defined and per sub challenge solutions
		are proposed. These can be accessed by hovering your mouse through the “skillmap”.

	<div class="communication">
		<h1>Tools for communication</h1>
		In this section we will primarily discuss the mentioned tools communication-wise. Communication is key in software engineering,
		but with globally distributed engineering, communication is harder to maintain. ... describes that a gap between two people
		<!-- TODO ... -->
		over 50 meter, drastically reduces the chance to meet up and talk. However there are a lot of tools nowadays that can help
		increase communication again which is beneficial for productivity. We divide communication tools into three subcategories,
		which are all important to closing the virtual gap between multiple software teams. The three sub categories are:
		<ul>
			<li>Share tools
				<!-- TODO: change this name into something fancier -->
			</li>
			<li>Task and reporting tools</li>
			<li>Free talk</li>
		</ul>

		<div id="share">
			<h2>Sharing is caring</h2>

			<h3>ConceptShare</h3>
			<p>
				ConceptShare is a communication tool especially designed for creative types. It helps you streamline the review and approval
				process for any project, and it allows for online proofing with workflow automation, which means you can work with clients
				from one place without having to send a hundred emails back and forth.
			</p>

			<h3>InVision</h3>
			<p>
				InVision is web-based (and mobile) app that lets designers/developers turn their work into active prototypes with animations.
				Clients can provide feedback and comments directly on the site and track progress in real-time by looking at your to-do
				list.
			</p>

			<h3>Screen Hero</h3>
			<p> This screen sharing software works well with Slack (who recently bought by them). Screen Hero allows members of the team
				to share their screen in real time, and to allow multiple cursors so you can actually pair program on someone else’s
				machine.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="tasks">
			<h2>Task and reporting</h2>
			<h3>Basecamp</h3>
			<p>
				Basecamp is a very popular web-based project management tool that helps multiple groups rally around a single project. Because
				the project is the focus, you can create a system where both you and the client are on the same page about various stages
				of the project.
			</p>
			<h3>Trello</h3>
			<p>
				Trello is another popular project management application system designed to break down projects into manageable “cards” that
				you can assign to different people. If you’re looking to create a collaborative team environment without worrying about
				being micromanaged (or needing to micromanage), Trello is the perfect solution. It also has the bonus of adding a visual
				element to otherwise technical projects.
			</p>
			<h3 id="asana">Asana</h3>
			<p>
				Asana is a free project management tool designed to help teams track projects from start to finish. One of its best features
				is that it lets you see the overall progress of your project step by step, so your clients know exactly how long something
				will take without having to bug you about it.
			</p>
			<h3>Wunderlist</h3>
			<p>
				Wunderlist is a to-do list tool that helps you plan your individual tasks, set notifications and reminders, and collaborate
				with clients so they can see exactly what you’re up to and when you’re working. The best part is that it’s available
				on both desktop and mobile so you can update it on the go. If you have clients who want to see the project laid out in
				detail, this will help.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="freely">
			<h2>Free talk</h2>
			<h3>Slack</h3>
			<p>Slack is a popular communication tool, and for good reason. It takes the best of email and live-chat features and combines
				them into one app that you can use on your desktop or mobile device. Aside from private messages you can also create
				collaborative boards around different projects or topics, which is helpful if you’re working with a larger team of people
				or on multiple projects with a single client at once.
			</p>

	<div class="coordination">
		<h1>Tools for Coordination</h1>
			Coordination in software development teams can be divided into the following categories:
			<ul>
				<li> Centralized Structure</li>
				<li> Early Identification of Dependencies</li>
				<li> Documentation</li>
				<li> Configuration and Integration Management Process</li>
				<li> Progress Analysis</li>
			</ul>
			The above categories all describe a domain where the coordination of a project becomes more difficult when the teams are
			further away from each other. These are thus the domains in which improvement of coordination is needed in order to bring
			teams closer together and make the whole developoment process go more smoothly. The coordination tools have a big overlap
			with communication as communiction is in fact a coordination tool.
			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<h3>Git</h3>
			<h3>Hipikat</h3>

			<h2>Identification of Dependencies</h2>

			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			<h3>Github Pages</h3>
			<h3>ReadTheDocs</h3>

			<h2>Configuration and Integration</h2>

	<div class="cultural">
		<h1>Tools for cultural differences</h1>
		<p>
			A problem that causes a gap between members of a global distributed software engineering project is culture. Using global
			distributed software engineering means working with people all over the world, people who thus have different cultures.
			These different cultures can sometimes fit together, but can also be a problem for people to work together. In order to
			bring down the gap between team members, cultural differences must be dealt with. To do so the following tools can help.
			<h2>Managing:</h2>
			Managing a culture diverse team is different from managing a team consisting of members with the same cultural background.
			To help manage a multi-cultural team there are three different aspects that can help according to 1:
			<h3>Systems to harmonize between outsourcer and supplier</h3>
			The first point can be done by using technology and coordination/control systems so members of the team can be kept up to
			date of the process of the project. For example using agile and scrum to manage the process of the project with tools
			like jira or github in order to keep track of issues.
			<h3>Understand differences in norms and values</h3>
			The second point is about defining the hierarchy/power between the members and the companies. State how different people
			practice business differently and define which aspects should be included in the project and which not.
			<h3>Encourage 'negotiated culture' of cross-cultural teams developing compromise 'working culture'</h3>
			The last point concerns the exchange of mechanisms between members, so that members can learn from each other and try create
			custom mechanisms for the current team that works with all the members.

			<h2>Staff:</h2>
			Choosing the right staff is another important aspect for overcoming cultural differences. 1 defines the following three points
			related to choosing the right staff:
			<h3>Recognize limits to cultural adaptation</h3>
			The first point states that there are limits to adaption of culture. So foreigners cannot become locals and vice versa. Don’t
			try to change people completely so that only one culture exists in the team.
			<h3>Use 'cultural bridging' staff</h3>
			The second point tries to have people in the team that is familiar with both cultures in the team. These people can help
			bridge the differences between the team members with different cultures.
			<h3>Use locally-relevant recruitment and retention incentives</h3>
			The last point is about the different salary and status/expertise acquisition. Make sure that these are according to the
			standards of the different culture, but are not too different in the team.

			<h2>Training:</h2>
			The last aspect is training. The team needs to be trained so they learn how to communicate and work together with the different
			team members. Three aspects can be looked into when considering training 1:
			<h3>Give pro-posting cultural training for supplier employees working in outsourcer companies (supplier)</h3>
			The first point is about learning the language and cultural practices, norms and values. This way team members know how different
			people have different views on various aspects.
			<h3>Develop systematic on-the-job cross-cultural training</h3>
			The second point is used to reflect on ongoing experience and share knowledge with colleagues, so that the team members can
			learn from each other and how they experienced and handle curtain (technical) situations.
			<h3>Recognize that training needs are two-way (outsourcer)</h3>
			The third point makes sure that not only the outsourced part of the team is trained, but the local team should be trained
			to work with different members as well. This way the local team can get familiar with the outsourced team members so they
			know what drives them and how the best communicate and work together with them.<br>
			<br> So in order to close the gap between different team members, cultural differences must be dealt with. By looking
			at managing, staff and training a diverse team can become easy to work with and should be efficient when doing globally
			distributed software engineering.
