# Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and create your branch
2. Write your content to the index.html file in your branch
3. To checkout your content during development, paste your branch name ([YOURBRANCH]) in http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/drennings/MindTheGap/blob/[YOURBRANCH]/index.html 
4. Merge (I meant do a PR) from your branch to the master before our next meeting!

BTW, you can find the GH page for the master branch @ https://drennings.github.io/MindTheGap/
And yeah, your layout during development will suck terribly since our GH pages theme doesn't render at htmlpreview.github.io nor locally (if you don't set up Jekyll)
