1. Clone the repo and create your branch
2. Write your content
3. To checkout your content on the GH page during development, paste your branch name ([YOURBRANCH]) in http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/drennings/MindTheGap/blob/[YOURBRANCH]/index.html 
4. Merge (I meant do a PR) from your branch to the master before our next meeting!
