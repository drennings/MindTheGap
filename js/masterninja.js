In addition, this is not limited to the planned communication (such as the daily stand ups and sprint reflections). The well renowned 'Allen Curve' from the seventies (<a href='https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/710021'>[6]</a>) describes that a gap between two people over 50 meter (or more) drastically reduces the chance of unplanned communicaton.",

There are many tools that benefit communication and workflow, in this section a few are named that stand out. All these tools can help to virtually close the gap to increase unplanned communication. There are a few types of applications that work via a sharing concept, most of them focus on sharing concepts, pieces of code or design quickly to the development team, management and/or clients.	Combined with communication aspects like a bulletin board per project or instant note sharing per design screen helps engagement across multiple people that does not necessarily have to be close to each other. Another benefit some sharing applications bring, is the possibility to share your whole screen, this benefits developers that are far away from each other while they can still work via pair programming.",
